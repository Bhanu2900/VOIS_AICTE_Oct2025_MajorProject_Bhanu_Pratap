## üåü Project Overview

This repository contains the complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) and strategic content trend analysis of the Netflix catalog. The goal is to identify historical production patterns, genre popularity shifts, and geographic content distribution to provide actionable recommendations for future content investment.

The analysis focuses on the dataset spanning content releases from the early 1900s up to 2020.

2.  What are the top-performing content genres, and how have their production trends evolved?
3.  How does content distribution differ between the top-producing countries (e.g., US vs. India)?
4.  What strategic recommendations can be made regarding investment in TV shows versus movies in key global markets?

## üí° Key Findings & Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis performed in the notebook, these are the primary conclusions and strategic imperatives:

### Content Trend Summary

| Market | Primary Focus | Key Trend | Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Global/US** | Balanced (Movies & TV Shows) | Strong, sustained growth in **TV Shows**, signifying subscriber retention value. | Maintain high-quality Original TV content. |
| **India** | Movies (Dominant) | Content is overwhelmingly **Movie-focused**, with a notable deficit in local-language TV series. | Major untapped potential in TV series production. |

### Strategic Actions

1.  **Aggressive Local TV Investment in India:** Launch a focused, high-budget effort to produce local-language TV series in the Indian market to balance the content catalog and capitalize on sustained audience engagement.
2.  **Maintain Premium Global Focus:** Continue strong investment in high-production-value, original TV Shows and Limited Series globally, while focusing on selective acquisition of high-impact films.
3.  **Genre Diversification:** Strategically increase output in high-growth, underserved genres (e.g., Documentaries or specific International subgenres) to reduce market saturation in core areas like Drama/Comedy.
